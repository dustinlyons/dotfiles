* org-roam to capture daily notes
  - each day, starts with a date and a basic log template
  - I take notes and easy shortcut to link and open new pages
    - This means I can write a projects "main" page with links to
      project pages
    - These projects will have todos
  - Daily notes will have todos
    
* how to recreate the "sidebar" or bookmarks?
  - need bookmarks for inbox of notes, 
  - shortcuts under ctrl-x? show up in panel?
    
* org-roam to capture "second brain" 
  - daily note when you open emacs with special command?
  
* org-agenda to view next actions vs org-ql pages
  - projects list
    can we open the doc the header is on from org-agenda?

* org-capture templates to input
  - new todo "inbox" items
  - new projects

* org-mode for recurring tasks
  - use a 'Recurring.org' within your second brain
